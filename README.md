# Mock-coding-quiz
## Description
In this project, i recreated a mock coding quiz , similar to that which may be utilised in a job interview. There is a timer in the top right which counts down , and goes to 0 if you run out of time or if you complete the questions. Getting a wrong answer removes 10 seconds from the clock and you are given continous feedback on wether you got a question right or wrong. At the tend there is an option to save your score into a leader board which updates position via simple subtraction. I found this challenge hard as i have never worked with multiple html and JavaScript files or APIs , so it took me some time to figure out how to link these all together .
